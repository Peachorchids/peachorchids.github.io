## Welcome to Mercy Michael Ihemedo's Page

### Why

I love technology and I am writing this page to talk about myself and my desire to be part of the IT industry. 


My name is Mercy Michael Ihemedo, I was born on 5th August 1990. I am single and i run my own business.


I grew up loving computer technology so much that i want to build a carreer on it. I developed the interest from watching movies about tech gurus and anything technology. I love anything software, cyber security, artificial intelligence etc.


I like brainstorming ideas and finding solutions somehow i got that skills from my teenage years because I am the first daughter in my family and I took up responsibility of providing and assisting my parents with my younger ones very much earlier in life.


Most of the IT courses I tried to enroll on costs an arm and a leg so i was not buoyant enough to go for it. I wanted to start somewhere that can help me learn while still making a living, that was how i started learning how to create websites with WordPress. I did more of self learning online, using youtube videos and research materials i gotnoff the internet. That was how i was able to started my own business. I source for product, import, create sales pages and promote on social medias.


Unfortunately I have not been able to fulfill that dream yet because my life has been a whole lots of ups and downs. But i have not given up on that. It has not really been an easy journey but I am grateful.


I was intrigued and so excited when a friend told me about TEA and linked me up to your website. I really wish and hope i will be able to meet up to your criteria for selection. 


I learn very fast and i like brainstorming ideas. I truly hope and wish you can help me actualize this dream of becoming part of the IT industry. I truly love to be part of it.
